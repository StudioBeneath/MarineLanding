##### 5. How Does Fergus Use Cookies?

Fergus uses technology in order to offer you the most convenient, secure and relevant services. An example of the technology that Fergus uses is a “cookie”. Cookies are an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies can be used to provide you with tailored information from a website. Fergus uses cookies to maintain our security requirements during your use of our website along with standard internet log information and details of our visitors’ behaviour patterns in order to obtain statistics of the number of visits and the popular parts of those website.

We may retain all personal information that we collect (on both our active systems and our archive systems), for as long as is necessary for us to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected (including for the purpose of providing services to you). For registration and account information, this means that the information is likely to be retained for the period of time that we consider your account to be “active”. An “inactive” account is where the account is not used for a continuous period of two (2) years.

The location at which we store your personal information will depend on the nature and purpose of the information and the manner in which you supply it to us. Fergus will at its discretion use, process, and store your personal information at our premises and/or storage facilities whether in New Zealand or another country. You hereby consent to this transfer. You further agree that this agreement and any issues relating to privacy matters is governed by the laws of New Zealand and each party submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts of New Zealand and its privacy laws.
